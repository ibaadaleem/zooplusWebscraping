"# zooplusWebscraping" 

This has 2 main components. The first is to go through the Zooplus website and store any relevant information I might want about cat food and store it as (json?) file. 

The second part is to load this information and do some cleaning to it to pull out some key info (e.g. is the food grain free) and then store it into an excel spread sheet for easy comparisons.
